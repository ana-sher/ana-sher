## Hi, I'm Ana 👩‍💻🌍

I’m a software engineer with a background in Python, C#, TypeScript and full-stack development. I’m broadening my focus to scientific computing, climate data analysis, and space-related projects.

🔭 What I’m Working On

**Climate Data Analysis & Visualization**: Using Python, xarray, pandas, and open datasets to study climate patterns.  
**AI/ML for Scientific Applications**: Experimenting with machine learning models to process and analyze satellite and environmental data.  
**Open-Source Tools**: Contributing to utilities for researchers and analysts to access, process, and visualize data.  
**Dynamic Data Parser & Mapper**: A personal project to parse, map, and clean data from websites and APIs.  
**danceflo.com**: Web application for studios and choreographers to manage their classes.  

🔧 My tech stack:

Languages: Python (FastAPI, PyTest, SQLAlchemy), TypeScript (NestJS, React, Angular), C# (ASP.NET Core)
Data Science: scikit-learn, MLFlow, Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, geopandas, xarray, matplotlib
Cloud & Infrastructure: AWS (S3, ECR, ECS, EC2, Lambda), Terraform, Azure (Pipelines, Container App, Web App, Key Vault), Heroku, Docker
DevOps: GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, automated CI/CD tools and libraries

🌱 Currently learning: deepening AWS + Terraform and Kubernetes knowledge, Python and ML-related knowledge as well as remote sensing and geospatial data processing!
